## Installation

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository into your wordpress theme folder
$ git clone https://github.com/jnds/wp-template-toolkit

# Go into the repository
$ cd wp-template-toolkit

# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

## Usage

```bash

# Run the gulp watch task to monitor changes in the file system. As soon as you save a file, it is preprocessed as needed and the browser is refreshed

$ gulp watch

# Run the gulp build task to erase existing build and theme folders and compile the latest version

$ gulp build

```

## Built with 

- [jQuery - Ajax](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_ajax.asp) - jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development.
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - Extensive list of components and  Bundled Javascript plugins.

## To-do

- Move the development source folder outside of wordpress and copy the build folder to the active theme folder
- Create a symlink to ACF JSON in the theme folder so that the source and theme are always in sync
- Improve organisation and structure of hooks and custom functions (see Timber Starter theme)
- Add boilerplate code for handling AJAX requests
- Add boilerplate code image srcset and lazyloading
- Add extra mixins and functions for typography & grid system
- Consider loading jQuery from a CDN instead of compiling a self hosted version
- Choose an alternative to bootstrap grid
- Setup intial component library
- Test accessibility and page load times
